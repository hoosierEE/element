This is an experiment with multiple aims:

1. to get more comfortable with modern C++
2. to deeply understand hardware acceleration
3. to create a variation of an existing programming language

I will generally follow the approach of [[https://craftinginterpreters.com/][Crafting Interpreters]], but with a few key changes:

1. target language is K
2. implementation language is C++ rather than Java or C
3. the implementation should employ hardware acceleration wherever it is both practical and beneficial.

Why "element"?
- chemistry puns: K is potassium, CUDA (Cu) is copper
- vector languages deal with "elements of a vector" frequently
- naming is hard
