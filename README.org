* Element
Combining the most delightful parts of K with good ideas from functional and mainstream programming languages.

- What: a close descendant of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)][K]] (and [[https://codeberg.org/anaseto/goal/src/branch/master][Goal]]) with implicit multi-core/GPU acceleration.
- Why: fun?
- How: Python prototype, then "for real" in CUDA/C++ (or perhaps [[https://ziglang.org/download/0.11.0/release-notes.html#GPGPU][Zig]] or [[https://pkg.odin-lang.org/vendor/OpenGL/][Odin]]?)
- Dream: a fast DSL for data-intensive kernels embedded in a distributed system environment like [[https://gleam.run/][Gleam]].

** types
- base types - int, float, string, symbol
- compound types
 - list-like
   - tensor - same type, N dimensional
   - vector - same type, 1 dimensional (simplest tensor)
   - list - any types, any shape
 - dict-like
   - table - keys (column names) are symbols, values are same-shape vectors
   - dict - keys are any fundamental type, values are arbitrary

** k crash course
K is a vector language descended from APL, with hints of lisp.
- Expressions evaluate right-to-left.
- Operators have equal precedence, so =a*-b+c= is =a*(-(b+c))=.
- Some operators are heavily overloaded based on number and type of their arguments.
  For example =*= has just two meanings (for =*x= and =x*y=) but =!= has 7 variants.
  These overloaded meanings are usually (but not always) related.
- Iterators like ='= (each) =/= (reduce) and =\= (scan) take the place of for/while loops.

#+begin_src k
 1+2 3 4                  /no-nonsense vectors
3 4 5
 +\(1 2;3 4;5 6)          /iterators modify verbs. "\" is "scan"
(1 2

 -1_(+9(|+\)\1 1)1        /first 9 fibonacci numbers
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
 {-1_(+9(|+\)\1 1)1}[]    /as above, but as a function
 {-1_(+x(|+\)\1 1)1}[9]   /parameterized with default first arg "x"
 f:{-1_(+x(|+\)\1 1)1}[9] /save function to the name "f"
 f'2 8 9                  /apply "f" to each (') item in vector 2 8 9, producing a list of results
(1 1
 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34)

** typical K features
Most Ks have:
- 1-dimensional vectors, nested lists, dictionaries
- value semantics
- an interpreter
- eager evaluation
- simple scoping rules (names are exclusively local or global)
- basic interaction with the host system
  + =\cd= to change directory without leaving the interpreter
  + run commands on the host system like =\ls=, =\pwd=
  + built-in file and socket I/O
- a method for loading/executing other K scripts
- dynamic typing:
  - no user-defined types
  - atomic types: integer, float, string, symbol ("booleans" use integers 0 and 1)
  - 1-d homogeneous vectors of any of the atomic types
  - implicit numeric promotion: =1+2.0= is =3.0=
  - heterogeneous lists containing any type
  - dictionaries with atomic type keys and values of any type
- mutable variables (but operations do not mutate their arguments)
- arithmetic operations defined for single values as well as collections. =1+2= is =3=, =1+2 0 3= is =3 1 4=
- structural operations on collections. =(1 2),`a`b= is =(1;2;`a;`b)=
- right-to-left evaluation, no operator precedence: =2*3+4= is =2*(3+4)=
- partial application or "projections" instead of closures: ={x+y+z}[1;;3]= is ={1+x+3}=

** Element is different from K
There are multiple K dialects with slightly different features.
Element is a direct descendant of [[https://codeberg.org/ngn/k][ngn/k]], but there are some differences.

Planned features:
- implicit hardware acceleration by default
  + small data processed on one CPU
  + big irregular data processed on multiple CPUs
  + big regular data processed on GPU
- lexical scope
- closures
- string data type (distinct from "list of char") as in [[https://codeberg.org/anaseto/goal/src/branch/master][goal]]
- short-circuiting =and= and =or= keywords also from [[https://codeberg.org/anaseto/goal/src/branch/master][goal]]
- =x:y= assign (immutable) variable
- =x::y= assign (mutable) variable
- No modified assignment operators. Use =a::a+1= instead of =a+:1=.
  Meanwhile, verb-plus-colon still invokes the unary version of that verb, so =a-:b= is =a(-b)=.
- No partial assignment to containers. If you assign the name =a= with =a::1 2 3=, then =a[0]::99= is invalid. Use =@= (amend) instead, and re-assign the whole container: =a::@[a;0;99]=. To improve performance, the implementation is free to reuse the original memory for =a= instead of making a copy.
- Lists and function arguments evaluate left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
  For example, =f[a+b;a:1;b:2]= or =(a+b;a:1;b:2)= are valid in K but not in Element.
  In Element, =a;b= always parses as two separate expressions evaluated left to right regardless of being wrapped in any kind of parentheses.
  Alternatives: use =a:1;b:2;(a+b;a;b)= or =2_(a:1;b:2;a+b;a;b)=.
# - Dictionary literals are a sequence of assignments enclosed in =[]= similar to [[https://kparc.io/k/][Shakti]]: =[a:2+q;b:5]= ⇔ =[`a:2;`b:5]= ⇔ =(`a;`b)!(2;5)= ⇔ =`a`b!2 5=
#   - =[a:1;42]= is not a dict literal because =42= is not an assignment
#   -

Aspirational features:
- module system: =require x=, =provide x=
- =\cd= etc. provided by REPL, not runtime

* Install
Compile for GPU with NVIDIA's =nvcc= compiler:
#+begin_src bash
cd element/src && make
./element
#+end_src

Or for CPU with =g++=:
#+begin_src bash
CPU=1 cd element && make
./element
#+end_src

* Why the name "Element"?
- chemistry puns: K is potassium, CUDA (Cu) is copper
- vector languages deal with "elements of a vector" frequently
- naming is hard

* Development Roadmap
This project is in the *experimental*, pre-alpha stage.
Some [[https://github.com/doctest/doctest/tree/master/doc/markdown#reference][doctest]] tests exist, but no coverage goals yet.
